# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added
- Light theme for every window (pill, cards, list, dialogs, panel, settings) and a Theme setting:
  System (follows GNOME's light/dark switch) / Light / Dark; `BAYLOOB_THEME` overrides it.
  State colours are darkened on light surfaces (≥ 4.5:1). All colours are tokens in
  `src/renderer/shared/theme.css`.

### Fixed
- Done card: with four buttons the row wraps instead of breaking labels.
- Panel "finished" banner: the agent name stays on the same line.

### Security
- The local API requires a token: Bayloob creates `~/.config/Bayloob/token` (32 random bytes, mode
  0600) on first start; the hooks send it as `X-Bayloob-Token`. Requests without it get 403, including
  `GET /state`. If the file is missing the hooks exit at once, so agents never block.
- `bun scripts/simulate.js auth` checks it against a running Bayloob.
