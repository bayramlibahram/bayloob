## Unreleased

### Security
- The local API requires a token: Bayloob creates `~/.config/Bayloob/token` (32 random bytes, mode
  0600) on first start; the hooks send it as `X-Bayloob-Token`. Requests without it get 403, including
  `GET /state`. If the file is missing the hooks exit at once, so agents never block.
- `bun scripts/simulate.js auth` checks it against a running Bayloob.
